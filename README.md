# 🧠 Classical Machine Learning & NLP Toolkit (Python)

A curated collection of Python scripts showcasing foundational **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** concepts using traditional techniques — without any deep learning or large AI models.

> 🚫 No TensorFlow, PyTorch, or transformers — just core Python, `nltk`, and `scikit-learn`.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository includes:

- 📝 **Text Summarization** using frequency-based word scoring
- 🧼 **Text Preprocessing** for NLP (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- 🧠 **Training Logic** for basic ML models using `scikit-learn`
- 📊 **Dataset Manipulation** with basic scripting and analysis

This project is ideal for:
- Students beginning NLP or ML
- Educators looking for teaching tools
- Developers exploring core algorithms without relying on heavy frameworks
