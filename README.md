# üß† PYTH_ML

A collection of Python scripts demonstrating core machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## üìÑ Project Overview

This repository includes:
- Text summarization techniques using classical NLP methods
- Sample dataset preprocessing
- Simple training logic for machine learning models (non-deep learning)

No modern AI libraries like TensorFlow or transformers are used. This project focuses on fundamental ML logic using standard Python libraries.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install nltk sklearn
python Textsummarization.py
python "data set01.py"
python training02.py
